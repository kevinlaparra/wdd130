    <h2>Kevin Laparra</h2>
    <p>Hey everyone. My name is Kevin and I am currently pursuing a degree in Software Development. 
    I am currently working in sales at a tech company here in Utah but im hoping that this degree will 
    help me jump into the development field!</p>
    <p>I currently live in Provo, Utah but originally I was born in Guatemala. I've lived in the states for about
    20 years now though so this is home. I grew up mostly in Arizona and am hoping to end up back there since it's 
    warmer there.</p>
    <p>I enjoy playing sports like soccer, basketball, adn even pickle ball. I am also really into music and trying
    to learn how to play guitar. I am excited to learn more about coding and to get to know you all!</p>
